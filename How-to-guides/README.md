Welcome to the MPConnect User Guide!

This manual is designed to help you use [MPConnect](https://mpconnect.io), the standalone web application for microplastics analysis and characterization developed by [AbbaTek Group](https://abbatekgroup.com).
MPConnect enables scalable and reproducible research and monitoring of microplastics by leveraging machine learning to automate the physical identification, characterization, and quantification of microplastic particles, enabling repeatable results without requiring specialized expertise.

## General Aspects

### Understanding Microplastics

Microplastics are small plastic particles with various physical and chemical properties:

- **Physical**: Shape, size (range), state of degradation
- **Chemical**: Polymer type(s), additives, fillers

Microplastics in a sample (also called a "matrix") can be measured by:

- **Number of particles** (count per sample volume/weight)
- **Mass content** (fraction relative to sample quantity)

Before choosing an analysis method, clearly define:

- The analytical question or objective
- The specific properties of microplastics to measure (e.g., size, shape, polymer type)

---

## Getting Started

### Working Environment

All analytical steps (sampling, preparation, detection) must:

- Be undertaken in a plastics-free or low-plastics working conditions.
- Avoid use of plastic tools (e.g. containers, tubes, vessels) unless they’re made from plastics not being analyzed.
- Prefer metal, glass, or ceramic labware and equipment.
- Use non-synthetic personal protective equipment (e.g. lab coats, gloves).
- Perform recovery tests during each analytical step to ensure accuracy.
- Where possible, perform sample handling in:
  - Laminar flow hoods
  - Cleanrooms (ISO Class 3 or better)

### Sample Sterilization

Determine if sterilization is needed (especially for wastewater, sewage sludge, organic wastes), as different sterilization methods can affect microplastic integrity:

| Method                          | Risk to Microplastics                            |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Steam sterilization**         | May melt microplastics                           |
| **Radiation** (gamma, beta, UV) | Can degrade polymer chains and oxidize particles |
| **Chemical sterilization**      | May chemically alter surface or structure        |

After sterilization, perform recovery tests to confirm that microplastics are still detectable and intact.

### Quality Control and Documentation

- Record all analytical conditions and steps.
- Include blank samples to check for contamination.

The number of blanks depends on the analytical method being used.
Blank samples help detect cross-contamination from:

- Airborne plastic particles
- Labware residue
- Handling errors

### Particle Size Classification

| Classification | Unit | **Microplastics** | | | | | |**Large microplastics**                                    |
|----------------|------|-------------------|-|-|-|-|-|-----------------------------------------------------------|
|**Particle size classes**|µm|1 to < 5|5 to < 10|10 to < 50|50 to < 100|100 to < 500|500 to < 1 000|1 000 to 5 000|
|**Average particle size**|µm|3|7.5|30|75|300|750|3 000|
|**Massᵃ**                |mg|1,4×10⁻⁸|2,2×10⁻⁷|1.4×10⁻⁵|2,2×10⁻⁴|0,014|0,22|14|
|**Number of particles in 14,13 mg**|number|1,0×10⁹|6,4×10⁷|1,0×10⁶|6,4×10⁴|1 000|64|1|

 ᵃ  Mass here is determined from the average particle size assuming spherical particle with a density of 1.
